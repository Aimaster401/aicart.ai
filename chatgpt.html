      <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
      <p>ChatGPT is a cutting-edge conversational AI chatbot developed by OpenAI. It's based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) family of large language models (LLMs) and is designed to engage in natural-sounding conversations, answer questions, generate text, and perform a wide variety of language-based tasks. ChatGPT has gained widespread popularity for its ability to understand and respond to complex prompts in a human-like manner.</p>

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Natural language conversation</li>
        <li>Text generation (articles, stories, poems, etc.)</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>AI Technology</h3>
      <p>ChatGPT leverages the power of transformer networks, a type of neural network architecture particularly well-suited for processing sequential data like text. The model is pre-trained on a massive dataset of text and code, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in language.  Fine-tuning and reinforcement learning techniques are used to improve its conversational abilities and align its responses with human preferences.</p>

      <h3>Pricing</h3>
      <p>OpenAI offers both free and paid access to ChatGPT. The free version is available through the ChatGPT website (subject to availability and usage limits).  ChatGPT Plus is a subscription plan that provides faster response times, priority access during peak hours, and access to new features. The ChatGPT API allows developers to integrate ChatGPT into their own applications, with usage-based pricing.</p>
