      <h2>What is Google Gemini?</h2>
      <p>Google Gemini is Google's most advanced AI model, designed to be natively multimodal. This means it's trained from the ground up to understand, operate across, and seamlessly combine different types of information, including text, code, audio, image, and video. Gemini represents a significant step forward in AI capabilities, enabling more sophisticated and intuitive interactions.</p>

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Multimodal AI: Understands and combines text, code, audio, images, and video.</li>
        <li>Advanced reasoning and problem-solving abilities.</li>
        <li>Code generation and understanding capabilities.</li>
        <li>High performance on various AI benchmarks.</li>
        <li>Integration with Google services and platforms.</li>
        <li>Scalable and efficient architecture.</li>
        <li>Potential for personalized and context-aware experiences.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>AI Technology</h3>
      <p>Google Gemini is based on a transformer architecture, a type of neural network that excels at processing sequential data. Unlike previous models that were primarily trained on text, Gemini is trained on a massive dataset encompassing multiple modalities. This multimodal training allows it to develop a deeper understanding of the world and to reason about complex concepts involving different types of information. The different versions of Gemini include Ultra, Pro, and Nano, offering different levels of performance and efficiency for different use cases.</p>

      <h3>Pricing</h3>
      <p>The pricing for Google Gemini depends on how it is being accessed.  Gemini Pro is available through the Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, each with their own pricing structures. Gemini Nano is designed to run directly on devices like the Pixel 8 Pro. As Google continues to integrate Gemini into its products and services, specific pricing models will vary. Check the Google AI Studio and Google Cloud Platform for detailed pricing information.</p>

      <h3>Pros & Cons</h3>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
