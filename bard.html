      <h2>What is Bard (Google AI)?</h2>
      <p>Bard is Google AI's experimental conversational AI service, powered by a large language model.  Designed as a competitor to ChatGPT, Bard allows users to engage in conversations, explore creative ideas, answer questions, and generate different creative text formats.  It is intended to draw on Google's vast knowledge base to provide informative and insightful responses.</p>

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Natural language conversation</li>
        <li>Creative text generation (poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.)</li>
        <li>Question answering</li>

      <h3>AI Technology</h3>
      <p>Bard is powered by Google's large language models (LLMs). Google has been evolving their LLMs, and Bard is currently powered by the Gemini family of models. These models are trained on a massive dataset of text and code, allowing them to understand and generate human-quality text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way. The models utilize transformer networks, a powerful architecture for processing sequential data.</p>

      <h3>Pricing</h3>
      <p>Bard is currently offered by Google as a free service, accessible through a web browser.  While Google may introduce paid features or integrations in the future, the core conversational AI functionality is presently available at no cost to users.
